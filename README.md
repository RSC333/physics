# Physics

## Python Programs Overview  
`OrbitalV` - Calculates the required velocity to maintain a stable orbit around a body in space given mass and distance.  
`RdMaxV` - Calculates the maximum velocity on banked, flat, and frictionless roads given radius, theta, and coefficent of friction.    
`EMNotes` - The formula tables for E and M.
