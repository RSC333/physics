# Physics

## Program Overview  
`OrbitalV` - Calculates the required velocity to maintain a stable orbit around a body in space given mass and distance.  
`RdMaxV` - Calculates the maximum velocity on banked, flat, and frictionless roads given radius, theta, and coefficent of friction.  

## To-Do  
`OrbitalV` - Add functionality to solve for mass or radius.  
`RdMaxV` - Add functionality to solve for minimum speed.
